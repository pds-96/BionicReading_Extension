## üîñ Project Summary: Bionic Reader Toggle Extension

The **Bionic Reader Toggle** is a Chrome extension designed to improve reading speed and comprehension by applying the **Bionic Reading** technique. It bolds the first few letters of each word to guide the eyes and help retain focus while reading online.

The extension adds a toggleable switch in the Chrome toolbar. When activated, it transforms the visible text of the current webpage into Bionic format. When deactivated, it reverts the text back to its original form.

### ‚úÖ Where It Works Well

* **Static or semi-static websites** like:

  * Wikipedia
  * Blogs
  * News websites
  * Online documentation and eBooks
* **Sites that reload fully on navigation**, allowing the content script to re-run properly
* Any page with rich, readable, and primarily text-based content

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* ‚ùå **Dynamic websites** (like LinkedIn, X, or Facebook) load content via JavaScript after page load; the current version does not track or update Bionic formatting for these new elements.
* ‚ùå **Does not observe DOM changes**, so infinite scroll or pop-up content remains unconverted.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Universal transformation** may affect non-readable elements (e.g., buttons, labels, or navigation).
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Reversion mechanism is basic**, using `<span>` detection, which might not cleanly revert in complex layouts.
* üîê **Does not work on `chrome://` pages or the Chrome Web Store**, as per browser security policies.
